# DeepBND
A Deep Learning-based method to enhance boundary conditions. This code has been used to simulate the numerical examples of the article "DeepBND: a Machine Learning approach to enhance Multiscale Solid Mechanics" https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11141.


Among other libraries, DeepBND relies on the following ones (some of them are installed automatically in the installation of previous ones):

fenics           2019.1.0 \n
multiphenics     0.2.dev1 \n
h5py             3.2.1 \n
hdf5             1.10.6 \n
meshio           5.0.2 \n
tensorflow       2.5.0 \n
pygmsh           7.1.12 \n
gmsh             4.8.4 \n
scikit-optimize  0.8.1 \n
mkl              2021.2.0 \n
mpi4py           3.0.3 \n
matplotlib       3.4.1 \n
python 		 3.8.10 \n
