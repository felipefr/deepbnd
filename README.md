# DeepBND
A Deep Learning-based method to enhance boundary conditions. This code has been used to simulate the numerical examples of the article "DeepBND: a Machine Learning approach to enhance Multiscale Solid Mechanics" https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11141.


Among other libraries, DeepBND relies on the following ones (some of them are installed automatically in the installation of previous ones):

library          version  \
fenics           2019.1.0 \
multiphenics     0.2.dev1 \
h5py             3.2.1 \
hdf5             1.10.6 \
meshio           3.3.1 \
tensorflow       2.5.0 \
pygmsh           6.0.2 \
gmsh             4.6.0 \
scikit-optimize  0.8.1 \
mkl              2021.2.0 \
mpi4py           3.0.3 \
matplotlib       3.4.1 \
python           3.8.10 \  
\
Obs: the default repository is conda-forge, otherwise pypi from pip. Versions should be taken as recommended releases and sometimes are not strictly necessary to follow this guideline exactly.
